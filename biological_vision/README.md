# Biological Vision

This repository contains an artificial intelligence (AI) project focused on biological image analysis. The goal of this project is to utilize AI and computer vision techniques to analyze various biological data and images for potential applications in medical diagnosis and research.

## Project Overview

### 1. Gene Expression Classification

In the `gene_expression_classification` directory, you will find a machine learning model that classifies genes based on RNA sequencing data. The model has been trained to distinguish between normal and cancerous genes, which can have significant implications for cancer diagnosis and treatment. This demonstrates the potential of AI in genomics.

### 2. Microscopy Image Classification

In the `microscopy_image_classification` directory, there are AI models designed to classify microscopic images of cells. These models can differentiate between normal and cancerous cells, aiding in the early detection of cancer. The AI models use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform image classification.

### 3. Tissue Image Segmentation

The `tissue_image_segmentation` directory contains an AI model based on the U-Net architecture. This model is capable of segmenting tissue images, such as CT scans, to identify regions of interest, such as tumors. It has the potential to assist medical professionals in quickly locating and assessing abnormalities in medical images.

## Future Applications

The biological vision project aims to leverage AI to revolutionize various aspects of biology and medicine. With the ability to analyze genetic data, classify cell images, and segment tissue images, this AI technology has the potential to accelerate medical diagnoses and research significantly.

## Getting Started
