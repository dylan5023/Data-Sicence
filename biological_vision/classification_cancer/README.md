# Genetic-Based Cancer Diagnosis AI

## Overview

This project aims to develop an artificial intelligence model to analyze genetic-based data and determine the type of cancer a patient has. The AI model can accurately classify cancer types based on the given genetic data and is optimized to address memory issues, making it run smoothly even on low-spec computers.

## Data

The genetic data used for training was collected using RNA Sequencing technology. Typically, this technology requires around 50mg to 200mg of samples, equivalent to the amount of blood in 1 to 4 droplets. This project could pave the way for diagnosing cancer with just a few droplets of blood in the future.

## Model

The primary model in this project is a Classification model. It utilizes genetic data to accurately classify the type of cancer a patient may have.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in running or contributing to this project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. If you encounter GPU memory issues, navigate to the `[GPU memory is insufficient]` folder and run the `main.py` file. This optimized version of the analysis reduces memory requirements, making it suitable for lower-end computers.

3. Explore the code, datasets, and AI model. Feel free to make contributions or improvements.
