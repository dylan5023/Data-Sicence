# AI Cancer Cell Classification

Welcome to the AI Cancer Cell Classification project! In this project, we aim to leverage the power of artificial intelligence, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to classify microscopic images of normal and cancerous cells. The goal is to develop a model that can identify cancer cells accurately, potentially reducing the time and effort required for manual diagnosis by medical professionals.

## Project Overview

Cancer is a complex and challenging disease to diagnose, and it often requires careful examination of tissue samples under a microscope. Some cancer cells can be difficult to distinguish from normal cells, making the diagnostic process time-consuming and error-prone. This project seeks to address this challenge by automating the classification of cancer cells using AI.

## Data

The project utilizes a dataset of microscopic images of both normal and cancerous cells. These images are located in the `data` folder. Can you differentiate between normal and cancerous cells just by looking at them? Even for trained medical professionals, distinguishing cancer cells can be challenging. This project aims to harness the power of AI to make this process more efficient and accurate.

## AI Model

Our AI model is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of deep learning models known for their effectiveness in image classification tasks. By training our CNN on the provided dataset, we aim to create a model capable of accurately classifying cancer cells.

## How to Run

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Execute the `main.py` file inside the [GPU Memory Shortage] folder.
2. The project has been optimized to work smoothly on low-spec computers by reducing the scale of data.

## Future Prospects

In the near future, it may be possible to diagnose cancer by drawing just a few drops of blood. This project represents a step toward that vision by utilizing AI to analyze gene patterns from approximately 20,000 genes, enabling the identification of different cancer types based on gene expression.
